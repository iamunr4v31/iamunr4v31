# Hello, I'm [Your Name] ðŸ‘‹

I'm an AI researcher specializing in Speech Synthesis with a strong interest in a variety of related topics within the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP). My work revolves around creating innovative solutions and advancing the state-of-the-art in Speech Synthesis for Indic languages. Here's an overview of my interests and research areas:

## Research Interests

- **Speech Synthesis**: My primary focus is on developing state-of-the-art Text-to-Speech (TTS) systems and techniques to generate high-quality synthetic speech.

- **Multi-Modal Language Models**: I'm intrigued by the intersection of vision, language and speech in AI models, exploring multi-modal approaches that combine text, images, and audio for a more comprehensive contextual understanding.

- **Voice Cloning**: I have a keen interest in the captivating field of voice cloning, which involves replicating human voices and creating personalized TTS systems.

- **Expressive Speech Synthesis**: I'm passionate about enhancing synthetic speech with emotional nuances and natural prosody to make it more expressive.

- **Natural Speech**: I'm dedicated to exploring the intricacies of natural speech, including accents, dialects, and conversational patterns.

- **Reinforcement Learning in NLP**: I'm intrigued by the application of Reinforcement Learning techniques in NLP tasks, seeking ways to improve dialogue systems and language models.

## Projects and Contributions ðŸ’¼

- [Roar: A Conversational toolkit for Indic Languages](https://github.com/iamunr4v31/Roar): Starting as a Nvidia/NeMo clone and building it as a personalized repo 

- [Deep RL](https://github.com/iamunr4v31/DeepRL): A repository containing paper-to-code versions of deep reinforcement learning algorithms.

- And a lot of private projects (for now) :sweat_smile:.
